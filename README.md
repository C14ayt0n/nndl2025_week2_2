# Titanic TensorFlow.js - Applied Changes Description

This project is a Titanic survival prediction application using TensorFlow.js. Below are the fixes and improvements implemented to ensure proper functionality.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. Data Analysis
- File: app.js
- Affected Functions: parseCSV, loadData
- Changes:
  - Replaced basic CSV parser with robust library
  - Added handling for quotes, commas within fields, and BOM markers
  - Implemented normalization for numerical and categorical fields (Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked)
- Reason: Charts in data analysis section were previously empty

### 2. Model Evaluation Metrics
- File: app.js
- Function: plotROC
- Changes:
  - Implemented ROC curve points sorting
  - Ensured AUC always displays positive values
- Reason: AUC showed incorrect negative values (e.g., -0.90)

### 3. Prediction
- File: app.js
- Functions: predict, table rendering
- Changes:
  - Converted TensorFlow output from multi-dimensional arrays to flat number structure
- Reason: Fixed "row[key].toFixed is not a function" error

### 4. Export Results
- File: app.js
- Function: exportResults
- Changes:
  - Added prediction transformation before CSV export
  - Implemented probability formatting
  - Included model saving capability via model.save
- Reason:
  - Ensure correct CSV generation for submissions and probabilities
  - Enable trained model downloads

## âœ… Final Results

| Component | Status | Fixes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CSV Parsing & Normalization | âœ… Fixed | Charts now display correctly |
| ROC/AUC Calculation | âœ… Fixed | No more negative values |
| Prediction Formatting | âœ… Fixed | Eliminated formatting errors |
| CSV Export & Model Save | âœ… Fixed | Proper file generation |

## ðŸš€ Current Status

All application stages now function correctly:

1. Data Analysis â†’ Working
2. Model Evaluation â†’ Working  
3. Prediction â†’ Working
4. Export â†’ Working

The application successfully handles complete workflow from data loading to model export without errors.
